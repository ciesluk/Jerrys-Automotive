A website made with NodeJs, MongoDB, JS, EJS, CSS. 
The website was to be a form on the main page. The user fills out the form. There are validations on the form as well if the user enters the information wrong. When the user submits the form it will take them to a receipt page and display their subtotal, tax and total along with other information. There is also a page called "/completeOrders". This page will show all the orders that have been saved to our database. In the project, there are also a views folder with our ejs files. The website was made with NodeJS, EJS, and MongoDB.

Setup --> Download the ZIP file, open the index.js file, and then in the database connection for MongoDB, just add your host.
